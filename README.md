🔍 About the Project

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and influenced by numerous factors. In this project, we use time series and supervised learning techniques to forecast prices and assist investors in making data-driven decisions.

🧰 Tech Stack

Python 🐍
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning models)
Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset

We use historical cryptocurrency price data from Kaggle or Yahoo Finance.

Features include:

Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
Moving Averages
RSI, MACD (optional)

⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-price-prediction.git
      cd crypto-price-prediction

2. Install dependencies:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
      jupyter notebook

🚀 Usage

Load and preprocess historical data.
Select and train ML models (Linear Regression, LSTM, Random Forest, etc.).
Evaluate models on test data.
Predict and visualize future cryptocurrency prices.
🧠 Model Overview

We explore the following models:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
ARIMA (optional for traditional time-series)
📈 Results

Evaluation Metrics:
